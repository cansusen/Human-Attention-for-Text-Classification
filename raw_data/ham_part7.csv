1,Excellent place for burgers our waiter Alex was awesome as well. The onion rings are the bomb. I had the blue cheese burger which was great. Cooked perfectly. This is somewhere I recommend you stop when in Vegas. Wait time can be a bit if your party is more than 2. Have the sweet potato fries too. Only need to order one side they are pretty large.

1,"First visit. I ordered the cod and shrimp basket with fries. It came with two pieces of cod and three shrimp. Just over nine dollars without a drink. Food was made fresh, about a ten minute wait.

1,"Food was delicious! We had the burger and fish and chips. The burger was juicy and fries crisp. But I have to say the mushy peas were my favorite! I had never had them before and am now a big fan! We asked the owner, and he described the process for making them.

1,Found this gem looking through Yelp reviews. I cannot find anything bad to say about this place. It is definitely a must to try this place out. Quality of the food and service is worth the 5 stars. Our server invited us to come back. That's politeness not verbalized often anymore and that means a lot to me as a customer. Try it!!!! You will be very happy for doing so.,yes,"<span>Found</span> <span>this</span> <span class=""active"">gem</span> <span class=""active"">looking</span> <span>through</span> <span>Yelp</span> <span>reviews.</span> <span>I</span> <span class=""active"">cannot</span> <span class=""active"">find</span> <span class=""active"">anything</span> <span class=""active"">bad</span> <span>to</span> <span>say</span> <span>about</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>definitely</span> <span>a</span> <span class=""active"">must</span> <span class=""active"">to</span> <span class=""active"">try</span> <span>this</span> <span>place</span> <span>out.</span> <span class=""active"">Quality</span> <span>of</span> <span>the</span> <span class=""active"">food</span> <span>and</span> <span>service</span> <span>is</span> <span class=""active"">worth</span> <span class=""active"">the</span> <span class=""active"">5</span> <span class=""active"">stars.</span> <span>Our</span> <span>server</span> <span>invited</span> <span>us</span> <span>to</span> <span>come</span> <span>back.</span> <span>That's</span> <span class=""active"">politeness</span> <span>not</span> <span>verbalized</span> <span>often</span> <span>anymore</span> <span>and</span> <span>that</span> <span>means</span> <span>a</span> <span>lot</span> <span>to</span> <span>me</span> <span>as</span> <span>a</span> <span>customer.</span> <span>Try</span> <span>it!!!!</span> <span>You</span> <span>will</span> <span>be</span> <span class=""active"">very</span> <span class=""active"">happy</span> <span>for</span> <span>doing</span> <span>so.</span> <span></span>"

0,Horrible service. We walked in and seated. There was 2 party that came after us. They were service before and still waited 20 minutes. My husband plate came and mind nothing after I asked the wait 10'minutes later. She said it was being cook. So I told her to camel the order. She did not bother to refill the chips or sala. We had to get the waiter attention.

1,"I love Sharp Edge- it's like my Cheers. Great selection of beers, nice people, good food- the bites are THE BEST. Go for the Jamaican Jerk bites. Also, really great deals at happy hour times and late night (my favorite time to go). The deal on pizzas late night is the best! The mussels are great too. I've tried them all! I think tomato bacon is my favorite.

0,"I picked this restaurant because of great reviews. I was very dissapointed. Received spoiled appetizer (crab with grapefruit), waitress with no hesitation offered a different one. Brought tampanadas that also had a wierd taste ,like old oil or something. Main dish was pretty good (shrimp with scallops). Desert was the best dolce Leche cake with fresh fruit.

1,"I really like this place.  My husband ordered the Samurai burger and it was to die for.  I ordered the Tabouli salad and it wasn't anything special but it was a healthy option and I would order it again. Order the dressing on the side. 

If the service had been better, I would have given the place five stars.

1,"My favorite pizza in Phoenix! The crust is amazing from the imported wood-burning oven! And the toppings are very high quality! Really delicious and a great value! My husband and I typically split the arugula salad, then a pizza and top it off with a heavenly cannoli. Super friendly family-run business.

1,My kids and I were looking for somewhere nearby to go bowling and stumble on flip side.

1,The food here is amazing! Everything I have ever ordered here has always been very good. Including the lattes! Only down side is that it becomes very busy and it does not seem the hostess knows exactly where to seat people... which makes it a bit longer of a wait. The food is worth the wait! It's delicious! The staff is friendly as well.

0,"This place is in a beautiful location. Atmosphere is nice and relaxing! Unfortunately the nightmare begins with the horrible service. I waited 30 minutes just to be served! Then when the simple pizza came out, it just kept getting worse. The flavor was not much better than eating ketchup and rubberbands. It's a pizza! It's harder to make it wrong then right!

1,"This place was absolutely wonderful.  Everything they gave us was absolutely amazing.  The Bosnian Coffee was fantastic and completely unlike any coffee I have ever had...and it wasn't just the taste, it was the whole presentation/experience.  The food was delicious and the family who runs the place are very kind (and helpful when we struggled to pronounce the names of the food). 

Definitely go visit this place.

1,"This restaurant is on Indian row, a bunch of Indian restaurants to choose from. We are glad we picked this one, such good food. Their Lassi was really good, and had multiple flavored. They ran out of a couple, that sucked. But what we did have we loved. We will be back again when we are in Vegas.

1,"We really liked this place.  I would especially recommend it for a lunch on a cold day.  It really struck me as good, hearty comfort food.  We loved the steamed buns.  They are sort of like having a good dumpling in Eastern European cuisine.
We had great service even though every table was full.
