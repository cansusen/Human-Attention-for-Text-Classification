We had the waitress who wore the hot pink lipstick.  After we were seated took hot pink, 25 minutes to come back to take our order.  I ordered the grilled marinated shrimp-just ok.  My husband ordered the lamb sandwich, next remove the fat and use more meat and the flatbread was stale.  This was not worth the one hour and twenty minutes.  We will never come back again and would not recommend the to anyone.   You are over rated.  Yuck!

1,"Ate there last night.  Not many people, probably due to the bad weather.  However, the food was excellent!  Everything I could have asked for.  The food was served in generous portions, and tasted great.  I felt that I was back visiting Turkey.

1,"Awesome food by an awesome group of guys!

We came by about 930pm (after reading great reviews about them) and it just so happened that they had just closed for the night at 9pm.

However after a short conversation with Josh, tired as he was....this owner gladly fired up the grill and went ahead and made us a couple delicious sandwiches!!!

We came by about 930pm (after reading great reviews about them) and it just so happened that they had just closed for the night at 9pm.

However after a short conversation with Josh, tired as he was....this owner gladly fired up the grill and went ahead and made us a couple delicious sandwiches!!!

And I will explain why:

1- This is NOT Italian food.
2- Lobster Ravioli with trace, taste or smell of lobster.
3- Overpriced
4- Nothing Italian about the 
...atmosphere ...decoration or even the music.
5- I tasted 4 different menu items...plus the a desert...still found nothing Italian! 

A bunch of patrons in flip flops and shorts dining in...explains the identity crisis of this place.

2- Lobster Ravioli with trace, taste or smell of lobster.
3- Overpriced
4- Nothing Italian about the 
...atmosphere ...decoration or even the music.
5- I tasted 4 different menu items...plus the a desert...still found nothing Italian! 

A bunch of patrons in flip flops and shorts dining in...explains the identity crisis of this place.

Waiter was ..meh..
Whatever..
I would never return 
Good Luck Chef!

1,"Best yakitori I've had. The garlic edamame was perfect! The pork belly was delicious, the duck with balsamic was also great. My boyfriend loved the beef misozuke, very flavorful and tender. The kire katsu was the best I've had, and the cabbage salad served with it was really good, with a delicious dressing.

1,"Came for the guacamole and stayed for the tacos. 

I ordered a Montreal beer and it was delicious. 

We ordered guacamole to split, it was just enough for 2 adults and one kid. If we'd had any others with us we'd need 2 orders. 

The guacamole was so good we decided to stay and split the Korean BBQ taco. It was AMAZING. Full of flavor. One order came with 2  nice size tacos that we were able to split between our party of 3. 

The service was fast and everyone was welcoming.

0,Came here for lunch on a rainy saturday. Place is cozy with only a few people around. The table was icky sticky as well as the tiled floor.  Ordered the sunrise burger (with sunny side up egg). First my order came without egg and sent it back. Then it came with an egg not just on top but smudged everywhere as if after frying they just dumped the egg on the burger. The burger wasn't bad and our server was a nice young black guy.

Got in an happy hour, and hard to beat $2.99 margaritas.  Watched the footy match during lunch. Nice experience. I will be back when my travels take me to Las Vegas again.",yes,"<span>Came</span> <span>here</span> <span>looking</span> <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>local</span> <span>Mexican</span> <span>restaurant</span> <span>with</span> <span>a</span> <span>bar.</span> <span>The</span> <span>review</span> <span>on</span> <span>here</span> <span>for</span> <span>the</span> <span>margaritas</span> <span>sealed</span> <span>it.</span> <span>I</span> <span>seated</span> <span>myself</span> <span>at</span> <span>the</span> <span>bar</span> <span>and</span> <span>was</span> <span>served</span> <span>drinks</span> <span>and</span> <span>chips</span> <span>immediately.</span> <span>They</span> <span>also</span> <span>serve</span> <span>a</span> <span>bean</span> <span>dip</span> <span>that</span> <span>is</span> <span>yummy.</span> <span>I</span> <span>had</span> <span>the</span> <span>fajitas</span> <span>and</span> <span>they</span> <span>were</span> <span>yummy.</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>too</span> <span>much</span> <span>meat</span> <span>and</span> <span>not</span> <span>enough</span> <span>veggies</span> <span>for</span> <span>my</span> <span>taste.</span> <span>But</span> <span class=""active"">delicious.</span> <span>The</span> <span class=""active"">grilled</span> <span class=""active"">steak</span> <span>was</span> <span class=""active"">delicious.</span> <span>Got</span> <span>in</span> <span>an</span> <span>happy</span> <span>hour,</span> <span>and</span> <span>hard</span> <span>to</span> <span>beat</span> <span>$2.99</span> <span>margaritas.</span> <span>Watched</span> <span>the</span> <span>footy</span> <span>match</span> <span>during</span> <span>lunch.</span> <span>Nice</span> <span>experience.</span> <span>I</span> <span>will</span> <span>be</span> <span>back</span> <span>when</span> <span>my</span> <span>travels</span> <span>take</span> <span>me</span> <span>to</span> <span>Las</span> <span>Vegas</span> <span>again.</span> <span></span>"

To me, there is absolutely no excuse for this. I wanted to send it back but felt it was safer in front of me just getting cold. Take my advice on this one, order 1 thing at a time. Last time I was there, I ordered the bruschetta and it looked great but just didn't compare to others I've had. I'll probably give them another try...

I really like the way this restaurant presents itself. The staff seem to really care about you having a good meal.

1,"Fantastic. Small menu but that's because it's a high-quality, small-scale place (just 8 tables). The couscous with beef and vegetables (Friday special) was superb. Last time there was a great Moroccan restaurant in the Heights, it didn't get enough business and closed. This place is just what Cedar-Lee needs, so go try it! Tonight they didn't have lamb-- but it's because the owner didn't like the look of the lamb at the market and wouldn't serve something not up to his standard. Now that's refreshing.

0,Food is basic canes always what you expect so it's good but the thing that got me is how shady the employees are at this location. They have promo tickets on the drink and the 2 drinks I ordered have already been peeled half way to see the prizes. I've never seen this level of scumbaggery from a fast food joint before. Tip to the management get it together! If something as simple as this goes bad I wonder what the hell else could be going on. Sadly I won't be returning to this location.

Food usually comes out fast but we are NEVER checked on again.  No refills or other drinks. Turns into a 3 hour visit.  If it wasnt for the excellent food I wouldnt be coming back.  Maybe Ill just get carry out from now on since it has been like this the past 5 visits (I go monthly).

The booths are huge, the greek paintings on the rotunda ceilings and the service is what makes this the total package. The menu is extensive, but could be overwhelming for some.

1,"Great service.  Our server went above and beyond for us.  She was so sweet and checked on us all the time but wasn't too intrusive.

The food was soooo good.  We had never been here before but we can't wait to go back.  Hope we have the same server!  The owner should be proud to represent his restaurant with such a dynamic employee as her.  Thank you!

The food here is simple but well executed bar grub. The staff is always attentive. If anything does go wrong they are very quick to fix it.

0,"Had dinner here with some friends. I was pretty disappointed. There are virtually no vegetarian options on the menu. I ended up eating a provolone fondue appetizer (it was decent, but not a meal). However, my friends really enjoyed their food. They had a DJ playing music. It was way too loud. We couldn't carry on a conversation. As a result we have not returned to this restaurant.

0,"Honestly terrible pizza. I can appreciate a good thin crust pizza but our pizza was literally 2mm thin, and had maybe 5 cherry tomatoes total and dried up, thin red onion. It was gross. The bread was alright but toughened up very quickly. The drinks never got refilled and the server was painfully rude.

1,"I am a Carolina BBQ fan and this is pretty darn good. The meat is tasty and moist without the sauce and even better with the signature vinegar tang.  I got the two meat platter with pulled pork and smoked chicken thighs, corn and mashed red potatoes, with hush puppies. About $19 including tax but it's a LOT of food. 10"" plate is loaded.

0,"i came here on a Friday night. it was summerlicious and we decided to try it. I had the apple salad which was quite good, but it went downhill from there.

1,I don't know how authentic is the French cuisine is here. It is Las Vegas after all but I had a nice dinner here. I had the Caramelized Scallops and it was delicious.

I would Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving for good authentic Indian/Pakistani food.,yes,"<span>I</span> <span>don't</span> <span>usually</span> <span>write</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>but</span> <span>I</span> <span>need</span> <span>to</span> <span>give</span> <span>this</span> <span>place</span> <span>5</span> <span>stars</span> <span>for</span> <span>sure.</span> <span class=""active"">This</span> <span class=""active"">place</span> <span class=""active"">is</span> <span class=""active"">a</span> <span class=""active"">heaven</span> <span class=""active"">for</span> <span class=""active"">chicken</span> <span class=""active"">tandoori</span> <span class=""active"">lovers.</span> <span>I</span> <span>haven't</span> <span>had</span> <span>better</span> <span>grilled</span> <span>chicken</span> <span>tandoori</span> <span>and</span> <span>biryani</span> <span>than</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span>There</span> <span>buffet</span> <span>is</span> <span>worth</span> <span>the</span> <span>price</span> <span>with</span> <span>a</span> <span>lot</span> <span>of</span> <span>options.</span> <span>The</span> <span>only</span> <span>thing</span> <span>I</span> <span>would</span> <span>say</span> <span>is</span> <span>that</span> <span>there</span> <span>isn't</span> <span>a</span> <span>lot</span> <span>of</span> <span>options</span> <span>for</span> <span>veggies</span> <span>out</span> <span>there</span> <span>but</span> <span>the</span> <span>owners</span> <span>is</span> <span>always</span> <span>kind</span> <span>enough</span> <span>to</span> <span>add</span> <span>something</span> <span>special</span> <span>if</span> <span>there's</span> <span>a</span> <span>veggie</span> <span>in</span> <span>the</span> <span>house</span> <span>as</span> <span>well.</span> <span class=""active"">I</span> <span class=""active"">would</span> <span class=""active"">Definitely</span> <span class=""active"">recommend</span> <span class=""active"">this</span> <span class=""active"">place</span> <span class=""active"">to</span> <span class=""active"">anyone</span> <span class=""active"">craving</span> <span class=""active"">for</span> <span class=""active"">good</span> <span class=""active"">authentic</span> <span class=""active"">Indian/Pakistani</span> <span class=""active"">food.</span> <span></span>"
0,I don't want to even give them a full star rating. Servers were nice. Wait time for food after ordering was 45 mins. They weren't busy and still waited forever. Salad was super watery and barely any dressing. Ordered spaghetti and meatball and also a shrimp Alfredo. Meatball was flavorless and noodles over cooked. Alfredo was super thick and tasted like it was from a can. Paid $4 extra for only 3 small shrimps in the Alfredo. Breadsticks were the only good thing to eat. Had to ask for refills of soda and water. Will never return here.

0,"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. I ordered the two slice with a drink special mainly because a whole pizza was at least $25. The two slices come and I immediately think this could be microwave pizza that you would get from a vending machine at your local ER waiting room. I digress, I taste it and it all changed!

I will make this review short and sweet.  It's nice to see coffee shops like this as opposed to the chains.  The staff is really nice, there are organic ingredients.  There is art on the walls.  The furniture is comfortable.  It's a very relaxing atmosphere.  I would definitely study here if I was a student again.

1,"I love this place! One of the best authentic Hawaiian dishes in Las Vegas.  Staff is super friendly. 

On top of their regular menu they also have daily specials.  You never know what dish they will have available for these specials so its always good to visit frequently.

1,"I miss Jewish delis in LA. Nate and Al's, Brent's Deli, Canter's, etc.

This is THE closest thing. 

I stopped in one morning when I was craving a heavy breakfast. I got the everything bagel with nova and cream cheese. 

For the first time in my life, I had a choice between Lox and Nova. If you don't know the difference, google it.

1) Went there on a Friday night with a bunch of out-of-towners and it turned out they had no ice for drinks.  We were not told this, just given drinks with no ice at 6pm outside in 110 degree temps.  No apologies.  Have you ever had a HOT (not even warm at that point) Malibu Pineapple?  Don't.
2) Got food poisoning here.  Granted, I ended up losing a few pounds from the whole ordeal, but overall, I probably would have passed on the experience, given the chance.

1,"I wanted to update and say 2 years later and I still love Mary Yoder's! We stopped I. Today and had their buffet lunch and it was so yummy. You cannot beat their home cooked goodness. I had the most wonderful plate of mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans and roast beef. I ate way more than I should have but it was delicious. I highly recommend a good family meal here if you are in the area. You won't be sorry! But try and save room for dessert! I skipped it today and now and sad!

The tacos were ok but over all not really worth the price.  Drinks were decent.  The decor and atmosphere were great but there were a large amount of flies.  I think there would have been less trouble with flies if we ate outside.

0,"I was truly was disappointed. I have been going here for years, but the other night was my last time.

Teriyaki wings- not really sure it was actually teriyaki sauce. And the celery and ranch were missing from the order. 
Baked potato- asked for sour cream and it did not have any on it. 
Turkey burger wrap- extremely salty.

0,"It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots.

The atmosphere is quaint and casual so much like several of the eating establishments in the N.O. area.  The staff is friendly and we always feel like we're home every time we visit.

Came for summerlicious dinner.  The wait staff were wonderfully attentive! They came to our table to explain each meal that arrived and were very receptive to our responses.  The quality of food on the other hand were a different story.  The dinner portions surprisingly small even for the $38 summerlicious bracket.  Desserts and drinks were quite well done but we left somewhat hungry even though our meal had cost the equivalent of a nice knitsweater from Zara.

1,My daughter had the spicey steam pot with a variety of seafood and pasta which was absolutely wonderful! Take note however that it does not contain any heavy spiciness at all.

1,"My favorite dining option inside Mekong. I love the vegetarian bun. Lots of noodles and lettuce topped with crunchy egg rolls. It comes with a dark, flavorful sauce that substitues for the traditional fish sauce. I would like to see another topping besides eggs rolls like a faux (pho?) meat.

 Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious. I can't specifically comment on any other dishes, but the family that I've brought here all love their dishes.

Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix and the top 5 best BBQ I've ever had. I have nothing negative to say about this place except you might feel a bit guilty after all the food you will have! The portions are pretty big without the big price tag.

The service was a nightmare. The food was bland. Save yourself the $200 and go to Guy Fieri's. Not only was the atmosphere pretentious for no reason whatsoever (it's not even up to par w/Gordan Ramsay's Steak), but the service and food was so disappointing, my husband and I wished we saved the $200 for 200 McDonald's cheeseburgers instead.

1,My parents have come here about three times and finally convinced me to try Floridinio's. The pizza here was so crispy and flavorful. They wood- fire their pizza and it comes out hot it was so tasty too! It's definitely the best pizza I've had in a long time. What really made the trip worth it was the bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream- it was perfect for the cold weather. The only reason this wasn't a 5 star review was because of the service. The service wasn't bad!

0,"Not worth the $35 per person after tip. The service was good, but most of the sushi was not fresh. Why do I know this?

this place is AMAZING... The burgers and chicken are cooked to perfection, not too dry and just the right amount of juiciness.

It's priced really well.. We ordered sandwich combos with drinks and waffle fries for 25 bucks for 2 people. 

Definitely visiting this place every time I come to Vegas! 5 stars hands down.

Strawberries weren't ripe, so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok. Overall, the taste wasn't pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to, or for their bakery items.",no,"<span>Ok,</span> <span>so</span> <span>A</span> <span>bunch</span> <span>of</span> <span>us</span> <span>went</span> <span>down</span> <span>to</span> <span>U</span> <span>of</span> <span>I</span> <span>for</span> <span>the</span> <span>weekend</span> <span>and</span> <span>someone</span> <span>we</span> <span>know</span> <span>said</span> <span>we</span> <span>should</span> <span>try</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span>It</span> <span>looks</span> <span>nice</span> <span>and</span> <span>their</span> <span>pastries</span> <span>are</span> <span>delicious...BUT...their</span> <span>crepes..are</span> <span>meh...</span> <span>I</span> <span>ordered</span> <span>the</span> <span>strawberry</span> <span>and</span> <span>cream</span> <span>crepes</span> <span>and</span> <span class=""active"">I</span> <span class=""active"">didn't</span> <span class=""active"">like</span> <span class=""active"">them</span> <span class=""active"">much.</span> <span>Their</span> <span>crepes</span> <span>had</span> <span>too</span> <span>much</span> <span>cream</span> <span>and</span> <span>the</span> <span>cream</span> <span>was</span> <span>very</span> <span>strong,</span> <span>over</span> <span>powering</span> <span>the</span> <span>crepes.</span> <span class=""active"">Strawberries</span> <span class=""active"">weren't</span> <span class=""active"">ripe,</span> <span>so</span> <span>a</span> <span class=""active"">little</span> <span class=""active"">sour</span> <span>in</span> <span>taste</span> <span>and</span> <span>the</span> <span>crepe</span> <span>was</span> <span>just</span> <span>ok.</span> <span>Overall,</span> <span>the</span> <span class=""active"">taste</span> <span class=""active"">wasn't</span> <span class=""active"">pleasing</span> <span>and</span> <span>I</span> <span>will</span> <span class=""active"">only</span> <span class=""active"">be</span> <span class=""active"">coming</span> <span class=""active"">here</span> <span class=""active"">if</span> <span class=""active"">I</span> <span class=""active"">have</span> <span class=""active"">to,</span> <span>or</span> <span>for</span> <span>their</span> <span>bakery</span> <span>items.</span> <span></span>"

Fresh! Appealing to the eyes! Smelled wonderful! From the first bite to the last, I enjoyed EVERY MOMENT! I didn't want it to end! My taste buds have been BLESSED! I ate so much...the 'Itis is kicking in!

Restaurant is clean. Folks behind the counter are welcoming. 
food is laden with spices, extra spicy that can succumb you the next day or two. 
Had to wait 20  minutes for 4 naans, naans are not that good.
We were over charged on all items except naan, so be aware. Menu flyers had different prices than what we were charged.

all in all this is ok place to go to for a quick take out, if you can handle spices.",idk,"<span>Ordered</span> <span>take</span> <span>out</span> <span>from</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span>1</span> <span>Nihari</span> <span>1</span> <span>Butter</span> <span>Chicken</span> <span>1</span> <span>Seekh</span> <span>Kabob</span> <span>2</span> <span>Pieces</span> <span>Chicken</span> <span>Tikka</span> <span>4</span> <span>Nan.</span> <span class=""active"">Restaurant</span> <span class=""active"">is</span> <span class=""active"">clean.</span> <span>Folks</span> <span>behind</span> <span>the</span> <span>counter</span> <span>are</span> <span>welcoming.</span> <span>food</span> <span>is</span> <span>laden</span> <span>with</span> <span>spices,</span> <span class=""active"">extra</span> <span class=""active"">spicy</span> <span>that</span> <span>can</span> <span>succumb</span> <span>you</span> <span>the</span> <span>next</span> <span>day</span> <span>or</span> <span>two.</span> <span>Had</span> <span>to</span> <span class=""active"">wait</span> <span class=""active"">20</span> <span class=""active"">minutes</span> <span>for</span> <span>4</span> <span>naans,</span> <span>naans</span> <span>are</span> <span>not</span> <span>that</span> <span>good.</span> <span>We</span> <span>were</span> <span class=""active"">over</span> <span class=""active"">charged</span> <span>on</span> <span>all</span> <span>items</span> <span>except</span> <span>naan,</span> <span>so</span> <span>be</span> <span>aware.</span> <span>Menu</span> <span>flyers</span> <span>had</span> <span>different</span> <span>prices</span> <span>than</span> <span>what</span> <span>we</span> <span>were</span> <span>charged.</span> <span>all</span> <span>in</span> <span>all</span> <span>this</span> <span>is</span> <span class=""active"">ok</span> <span class=""active"">place</span> <span>to</span> <span>go</span> <span>to</span> <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>quick</span> <span>take</span> <span>out,</span> <span>if</span> <span>you</span> <span>can</span> <span>handle</span> <span>spices.</span> <span></span>"

Restaurant is clean. Folks behind the counter are welcoming. 
food is laden with spices, extra spicy that can succumb you the next day or two. 
Had to wait 20  minutes for 4 naans, naans are not that good.
We were over charged on all items except naan, so be aware. Menu flyers had different prices than what we were charged.

all in all this is ok place to go to for a quick take out, if you can handle spices.",idk,"<span>Ordered</span> <span>take</span> <span>out</span> <span>from</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span>1</span> <span>Nihari</span> <span>1</span> <span>Butter</span> <span>Chicken</span> <span>1</span> <span>Seekh</span> <span>Kabob</span> <span>2</span> <span>Pieces</span> <span>Chicken</span> <span>Tikka</span> <span>4</span> <span>Nan.</span> <span>Restaurant</span> <span>is</span> <span class=""active"">clean.</span> <span>Folks</span> <span>behind</span> <span>the</span> <span>counter</span> <span>are</span> <span class=""active"">welcoming.</span> <span>food</span> <span>is</span> <span>laden</span> <span>with</span> <span>spices,</span> <span>extra</span> <span>spicy</span> <span>that</span> <span>can</span> <span class=""active"">succumb</span> <span>you</span> <span>the</span> <span>next</span> <span>day</span> <span>or</span> <span>two.</span> <span>Had</span> <span>to</span> <span>wait</span> <span>20</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>for</span> <span>4</span> <span>naans,</span> <span>naans</span> <span>are</span> <span class=""active"">not</span> <span>that</span> <span class=""active"">good.</span> <span>We</span> <span>were</span> <span class=""active"">over</span> <span class=""active"">charged</span> <span>on</span> <span>all</span> <span>items</span> <span>except</span> <span>naan,</span> <span>so</span> <span class=""active"">be</span> <span class=""active"">aware.</span> <span>Menu</span> <span>flyers</span> <span>had</span> <span>different</span> <span>prices</span> <span>than</span> <span>what</span> <span>we</span> <span>were</span> <span>charged.</span> <span>all</span> <span>in</span> <span>all</span> <span>this</span> <span>is</span> <span class=""active"">ok</span> <span>place</span> <span>to</span> <span>go</span> <span>to</span> <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>quick</span> <span>take</span> <span>out,</span> <span>if</span> <span>you</span> <span>can</span> <span>handle</span> <span>spices.</span> <span></span>"

We ordered 3 simple appetizers with no one else in place and it took 35 minutes to get food.  Another 2 people came in 20 minutes after we ordered and ordered full meals and they got their food before we did.

We noticed the hispanic cooks seems to do the other 2 customers food first because they were hispanic.

0,Pretty irritated. Drove almost 20 mins from home to here to eat. I didn't feel like late night fast food so I picked this spot. I get to the door and it's locked. Website says it's open for another hour and 10 minutes. Open sign is still lit up. Girl washing the window says they close at 1am. It's currently 12:45 am and the website states 2am (according to Yelp anyway). I specifically picked this spot because it said it would be open.

0,"Really mediocre food, inattentive; bordering on rude service and no ambiance. This place was recommended to me by a woman waiting for a table at another restaurant. We were discussing good Indian and she claimed that Godavari is the best in Charlotte.

1,"So even though this place is a chain restaurant, this review is specifically for this location. First off, their menu is HUGE but I always order the same thing when I go to this place: Country Fried Steak. It's their most popular breakfast dish and the gravy is oh so good. You can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict either. Their hollandaise is sublime. When it comes to breakfast I prefer the hash browns over the fried potatoes. Portions at this place are massive.

Today is Valentine's day and I know things get busy, so I had called earlier this week to make a reservation.

1,"The smoked meat sandwich! The pickles! The perfectly crispy fries! And the selection of mustards!

Okay, so Caplansky's has a lot of things that I already love, but they do them so well. The smoked meat sandwich lived up to the hype and the pickles were the perfect combination of sour and salty. The array of mustard was delightful to sample.

If you're looking for cheap eats that are good definitely check out this place.",yes,"<span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span class=""active"">great</span> <span>sandwich</span> <span>place</span> <span>(don't</span> <span>get</span> <span>me</span> <span>wrong)</span> <span>which</span> <span>is</span> <span>why</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>giving</span> <span>it</span> <span class=""active"">4</span> <span class=""active"">stars,</span> <span>but</span> <span>the</span> <span>4.5</span> <span>overall</span> <span>rating</span> <span>on</span> <span>Yelp</span> <span>with</span> <span>1300+</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>makes</span> <span>it</span> <span>seem</span> <span>like</span> <span>this</span> <span>place</span> <span>is</span> <span>slightly</span> <span>overrated.</span> <span>It's</span> <span>dirt</span> <span>cheap</span> <span>for</span> <span>Vegas</span> <span>which</span> <span>is</span> <span>great</span> <span>because</span> <span>food</span> <span>places</span> <span>that</span> <span>sell</span> <span>sandwiches</span> <span>for</span> <span>$6</span> <span>on</span> <span>the</span> <span>strip</span> <span>is</span> <span>virtually</span> <span>impossible</span> <span>to</span> <span>find.</span> <span>The</span> <span>sandwich</span> <span>itself</span> <span>(got</span> <span>the</span> <span>Original</span> <span>which</span> <span>was</span> <span>roast</span> <span>beef,</span> <span>cheddar,</span> <span>and</span> <span>horseradish</span> <span>sauce)</span> <span>was</span> <span class=""active"">very</span> <span class=""active"">good,</span> <span>but</span> <span>a</span> <span>little</span> <span>bit</span> <span>on</span> <span>the</span> <span>small</span> <span>side.</span> <span>If</span> <span>you're</span> <span>looking</span> <span>for</span> <span>cheap</span> <span>eats</span> <span>that</span> <span>are</span> <span>good</span> <span>definitely</span> <span>check</span> <span>out</span> <span>this</span> <span>place.</span> <span></span>"

1,"This is by far one of the best burgers in the city.  I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now.  Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese.  OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection.  That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good.  Might even go back tomorrow for another!!!
Very clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover.

Ordered appetizers that were delivered 20 minutes after dinner which was delivered after waiting 45 minutes! I had to ask the waitress if she wanted me to carry  the leftover pizza out with my hands because she never even offered a box for leftovers.

We actually had a serve get fired in the middle of serving us! Recommend that you sit at the bar and order drinks. It you're determined to eat, make sure it's not when they are crowded!

**Update**
I can't make this up. Went to Bar Louie for brunch on 9/10. The cook messed up our order of omelettes TWICE!!!! And the coffee was cold.

1,"This place is my favorite for lunch!  After discovering Baiz on yelp I have been back for lunch almost once a week, sometimes more.  I usually get the chicken shawarma plate.  Wish it came with hummus, but it's available as a side.  Kabobs are good also, but they take awhile because they are cooked to order.  They make their own pita, it's always fresh.

0,This place is so underwhelming. Was looking forward to trying it out but the food was so so. Service even more mediocre. Overpriced. The margarita was one of the worst I've had. We complained about the speakers being way too loud at the downstairs bar and the bartender looked at us sideways.

0,This place started off awesome.  Their portions and quality have gone downhill while prices have remained the same.

1,"This was the best dinner I had in vegas. We got:

the lobster sushi roll- really tasty and light, great app
the spring mix salad (not sure on the name)- Not great... I wouldn't get it again
the sashimi tuna-AMAZING the best tuna I have ever had, and the sesame seeds added a great flavor
the gorgonzola mac and cheese- Mac and cheese with gorgonzola... do I really need to say how tasty this was?
the butter cake-super moist and sweet, good texture and flavor

1,Tried it a second time and I ordered the almond milk tea. I thought this would give me a better idea of the place because I'm familiar with almond milk tea.

1,"Very authentic Mediterranean cuisine. We got the meat platter which was delicious and we split it.  With the groupon, it was a great deal of $22 for $40 worth of food.

0,"Very mediocre. Mediocre service. Mediocre food. Mediocre atmosphere. This place is only here for people who drunkenly stumble in wanting big portions for a good price. The nacho plate was huuuuuge so I'll give them that but it was so average, a toddler could make it at home. The lava shrimp was way too spicy with no flavor at all.

Finally when the hostess appeared she wasn't pleasant to the customers at all and notified us it would be at least 45 minutes for our dinner order to be cooked. At this point we left!

0,"Well their food is great, we have tried nearly everything on their menu. However, within the last 3 times we have ordered from this place they have consostently pushed nearly 2 hours for deliveries which is ridiculous, they never used to be this slow.

0,"Went for lunch with my cousin today and I ordered the lobster bibimbap and she had the beef bulgogi. 

The food was very bland and incredibly over priced. Atmosphere was good and service good. Food sucked. Definitely not like a traditional Korean restaurant, where the food is much better and tastier and the prices are way less expensive. 

My cousin's order wasn't so great either. ""This doesn't taste so great, but at least I'm eating healthy"" was her comment to the very low low sodium levels in both our dishes. 

Overall, my experience was ok. I wouldn't go back.

The Oscar style was cold crab meat with luke warm asparagus in a cream sauce.  Oh, paying for stilled water which is probably tap water is a crime.  I definitely won't come back here and prob won't visit a Gordan Ramsey place again. FYI there is a tasting menu for 145 a person per table but you get a autograph.  Aka.

0,Worst place ever!! I've eaten at this place 3 times. The first time the chicken wings that I got were cold and I couldn't eat them. The 2nd time I found a hair in my rice and asked if I could just get my money back after being so disgusted they only gave me half my money back because they said that I are half even though I had only had one or 2 bites and the 3rd time was alright but it is also very pricey.

Ordered the French Toast and Bacon.

The bread they use for the French Toast has a tougher crust, so a lot of the batter didn't absorb into the bread. Making each bite kind of half bread, half french toast. It also wasn't cooked properly and had some parts which were basically just batter soaked bread.

The Bacon was cold and obviously not made to order.
